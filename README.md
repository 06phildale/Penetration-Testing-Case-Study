# Penetration Testing Case Study

## Objective

The Penetration Testing Case Study project involved assessing the security of a client-provided system by performing ethical hacking exercises. The goal was to identify potential vulnerabilities in exposed services, exploit a backdoor vulnerability, and demonstrate unauthorized access using controlled penetration testing techniques. This project strengthens understanding of network security, vulnerability assessment, and ethical hacking practices.

### Skills Learned

- Conducting network discovery and port scanning using tools like Nmap and Netdiscover.  
- Identifying service vulnerabilities and researching exploit options using Metasploit.  
- Exploiting known vulnerabilities in a controlled environment to gain root access.  
- Extracting sensitive data (e.g., password files) and demonstrating proof-of-concept attacks.  
- Applying structured penetration testing methodologies and reporting findings responsibly.

## Steps

*Ref 1: Network Scanning*  
Performed host discovery and port scanning to identify active services and potential vulnerabilities.

*Ref 2: Vulnerability Research*  
Analyzed open services for outdated versions and backdoor vulnerabilities using Metasploit.

*Ref 3: Exploitation*  
Executed a backdoor exploit to gain root access, demonstrating the vulnerability in a controlled environment.

*Ref 4: Password Extraction*  
Extracted hashed passwords from the system and performed brute-force attacks to reveal credentials.

*Ref 5: Proof of Concept*  
Logged into the client’s portal using the retrieved credentials to validate the success of the penetration test.
